## Project Overview

Leveraging the power of React, we created a quasi-clone of Rotten Tomatoes dubbed Rancid Tomatillos! This application provides a list of movie cards from an API with their poster image and rating, which can each be individually clicked on by the user which routes to a movie summary page (utilizing a different endpoint) which includes all of the specific movies details, a promotional photo, and a movie trailer. 

The [Turing School of Software and Design](https://turing.edu/) provided a project spec sheet for students to follow. [Rancid Tomatillos](https://frontend.turing.edu/projects/module-3/rancid-tomatillos-v3.html).

## Learning Goals

### Part 1

* Gain competency with React fundamentals and continue using ES6 syntax
* Create a multi-page UX using React Router
* Learn how to test React components & asynchronous JS using Cypress
* Write modular, reusable components that follows SRP (Single Responsibility Principle)
* Make network requests to API endpoints to retrieve and manipulate data


## Technologies and Tools

* JavaScript
* React
* HTML
* CSS
* Cypress
* Mocha
* Chai
* Fetch API
* NPM
* Webpack
* Heroku


## Roadmap

Future features could include:

* Adding functionality to allow a user to add personal ratings
* User favorite movies section
* A "theatre-suite" where movies can be added using POST
* Add more error-handling to search-bar prevent notify the user that there are no matches
* Prevent movie details from rendering $0.0 for budget and revenue to instead render "No data available"

## Setup
1. Fork and clone this repository
2. Cd into the root directory and run `npm i`
3. To run this server, run `npm start` in the terminal and React will start the development server. To stop the local server, use command `Control + C`. 
4. Open a browser window and go to http://localhost:3000 to view the website
